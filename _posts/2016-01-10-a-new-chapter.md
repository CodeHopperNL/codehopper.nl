meta-description: After two years of service, it's time to move on. No longer a CTO, I glance at the world as my oyster, but as my memory is proverbially awful it's best to keep notes of why I'm doing this.

*NOTE: these are the words that I wrote to myself on October 31st 2016, the day
in which I left my then-current company. The piece was written with the intent
of being published, in case people who regard my opinion on working things can
have a look at how I reflect on my own decisions. Happy reading!*

Dear future me, here's you at the very end of your experience at Sytac.

Yes, you multiple personalities weirdo.

As of today you are not anymore on office as the CTO of [Sytac](http://www.sytac.nl),
the IT consulting company you've part of in the last two years. As your memory is proverbially
awful, I hope these notes will give you a better perspective on how you feel
at the moment, surely a better one than what you *think* you had.

# On leaving

Yes, you quitter.

It's not the first time you leave colleagues you loved behind,
and you firmly believe that either you are part of the solution, or you are part
of the problem. Yet to leave is like declaring to the general public that you
believe to be part of the problem, so what's up with that?

Well, that's true. With all your ideas and suggestions and big mouth and stuff,
you weren't able to fix the problems that always bothered you, making you 100%
part of the problem, certified. Deep inside you almost always knew that you
were not cut for leading Sytac to revolutionize itself on your terms, and maybe
that was even a foolish thing to hope for in the first place.

Yet, you wanted to believe and ran circles *around* the main issues without facing the
biggest obstacles first. You feared you would have crushed on them anyway.

So yes, better leave and give way to the new. But remember: next time, face the
biggest issues first, or else you might find yourself wasting precious time
chasing windmills.

# On career

Yes, your ego.

As pretty much everyone that ever wrote some software, you have a big
thirst for the alpha-nerd recognition. You did prove yourself here, so much that
you earned the C level. That was a morality booster for you, wasn't it?

The thing is, for you the most important part of getting up the ladder is to
prove yourself that you are capable of handling the bigger headaches that any
new accomplishment comes with. One step up, and you take due note that ok, that
is something you can do if you want. You fed your ego enough, time to move on.

At this point you have evolved from an insecure, awkward nerd into an accomplished
professional who craves stage time and public attention. Your ego has inflated
enough, and at the moment you look at that CTO thingy more as an uncomfortable
position: if you are the top dog, who will you learn from?

But by now you know it all too well, that you care almost nothing for what step of
the ladder you occupy: do something great and do it good, that's what makes you
open your tail like a <pavone>.

# On having guts

Yes, you sissy.

Despite your quite evident issue of logorrhea, you missed many
occasions in which you could open your damn mouth when it really mattered. You
saw potential and you didn't fight to realize it. And you know why? You didn't
think you could win it. And maybe you could not, but that's beside the point.

Make sure you always try your best, and if you think that's not enough then be
open and admit failure. In software as in life, fail fast is always the best
option for everyone involved.

# On closing

Yes, you blatant fool, time to close this psycho letter.

The past two years have been an interesting journey, and you did grow personally
and professionally and you [did things](http://amsterdam2016.codemotionworld.com)
you never dreamt you could handle. And as you know yourself good enough, that can
only mean that bigger challenges are ahead.

Brace yourself, for the journey and keep your focus sharp on things that really
matter to you. But as you who read this is me in the future, you know that better
than me.
