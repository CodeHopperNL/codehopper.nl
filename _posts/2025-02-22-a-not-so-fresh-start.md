# Writing content in the age of generative AI

[Already in 2008]({% post_url 2008-12-20-here-we-are-again %}) I had my doubts that writing into a Blog was really going to be a long running endeavor, and especially now that a growing % of the
content that we consume comes straight out of an LLM it seems like maintaining an active blog is the least thing the world needs me to do.

And yet, guess what? I feel like writing again ðŸ˜±

So yeah, you might read some stories here in the coming days / months / years / whatever time frame that will be. In the meanwhile, you can have fun with [an LLM-generated game of
life](https://claude.site/artifacts/89e53e5d-b735-4aa4-8264-5e9e122349e0), courtesy of Claude.
